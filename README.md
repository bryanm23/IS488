# IS488
IS488 Independent Study Fall 2024.

This project consists of a semester long project including research into the fine tunings of the Microsoft Operating System.
My goal was to create a lightweight and customizable Antivirus Solution to focus on overpermissive programs, and programs that are generally not detected by the traditional Antivirus Software.

# How to use
In this repository, you will find everything needed to run the program. Of course, it will not be of any use unless you use your own reports ran on your machine(s). In order to get this on your machine, please clone the repository or download it onto your machine.
This program works best when ran in a terminal using an editor, such as VSCode. This allows you to specify the directories where the reports and baseline were downloaded/ran on your machine.

# Details about the Project
Doing testing with various tools included in the Microsoft Sysinternals Suite and additional tools such as Performance Monitor and Process Monitor, I was able to delve into the details of the Microsoft Operating system and understand how programs work.
This includes the use of the Dynamic Link Library (DLLs), RAM and CPU utilization, among many other things.
